# Socoeur — Social Media Charter v2

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Image is primary. Design is secondary.

The feed is photography-driven.
Visual authority comes from composition, light, and structure.

## VISUAL DIRECTION

- Architectural lines
- Symmetry when possible
- Structured compositions

The jersey red must be the strongest visual element in the frame.
All other tones remain neutral and supportive.
