# Socoeur — Content System

This repository is the structured content system for Socoeur.

It centralizes the strategic and operational foundations of the brand’s social media and content production. It does not store visual assets (photos, videos, design files). Instead, it contains the structural layer that ensures coherence, scalability, and long-term brand consistency.

This repository functions as the strategic brain of the content operation.

## Purpose

The goal of this system is to:

- Maintain strong visual and editorial consistency
- Structure AI-assisted content generation intelligently
- Keep production lean and agile
- Separate strategy from execution
- Protect long-term brand positioning
- Enable scalable content operations across collections

This system is designed to support the World Cup 2026 chapter and future brand evolutions.

## Brand Context

Socoeur is a contemporary cultural brand rooted in Switzerland.  
It is fashion-led and references football as a cultural language.  
It is not a sports merchandise brand.

The brand represents:

- Contemporary Switzerland  
- Multicultural identity  
- Urban architecture  
- Graphic clarity  
- Precision  
- Confident restraint  

Football is a language, not the category.

## Content Philosophy

Image is primary. Design is secondary.

The brand’s visual identity is driven by:

- Architecture
- Structure
- Neutral tones
- Soft warm natural light
- Clean framing
- Controlled movement

Red belongs only to the garment.  
Text on screen is rare and minimal.

Tone of voice is:

- Direct
- Calm
- Structured
- Confident
- Cultural

Avoid hype language, exaggeration, superlatives, emojis, and aggressive sales tone.

## Sprint Structure

Content operates in structured phases:

Sprint 1 — Cultural Tease  
Sprint 2 — Fragment Reveal  
Sprint 3 — Official Drop  
Sprint 4 — Tournament Mode (conditional)

Each sprint increases clarity and intensity while maintaining aesthetic consistency.

## Available Content Formats

Urban Presence  
Structured architectural composition. Minimal movement. Visual authority first.

Material Focus  
Macro detail. Fabric, stitching, precision. Neutral background.

Controlled Motion  
Subtle modern movement. Clean cuts. Refined social rhythm.

Formats define structure.  
Concepts define creative execution.

## How the System Works

Strategy lives in this repository.

Execution lives in the operational Google Sheet:

Socoeur_Content_OS

Each content piece moves through the following statuses:

Idea → Scripted → Ready to Shoot → Shot → Edited → Ready → Published

AI is used to:

- Generate scripts
- Generate captions
- Produce structured variations
- Analyze trends

AI is not used to define strategy.  
Creative direction remains human-led.

All AI generation should reference the `master_context_prompt.md` file to ensure coherence.

## Repository Structure

socoeur-content-system/

- README.md  
- prompts/ (format prompts, brand prompts)  
- docs/ (charter, roadmap, master context)  
- sprints/ (phase planning)  
- concepts/ (creative executions per sprint)  
- automation/ (n8n workflows and structured logic)  

This repository evolves intentionally and slowly.  
It should not become a storage space for assets or scattered ideas.

## Operating Principles

Consistency over volume.  
Clarity over complexity.  
Structure over improvisation.  
Automation only where it adds real value.  
Creativity remains human-led.  

This system is designed to evolve without compromising identity.# socoeur-content-system
